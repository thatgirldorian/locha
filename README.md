 This is a testing framework built with JavaScript and Node JS. It can test applications in the browser and via the command line. I decided to build it out to better understand how testing works under the hood. This framework:
 - collect files
 - test the environment setup/configuration
 - test file execution 
 - report the results

I learnt a lot about how testing works with this one and also got to use some neat packages. 
 

<h3>Technology used:</h3>

- JavaScript
- GitHub
- The Cli-color package (for string styling)
- The Jsdom package (provides a copy of a running browser inside Node JS to run browser-based testing)
